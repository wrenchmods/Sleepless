{"name":"Sleepless","tagline":"Sleepless","body":"### Welcome to my project\r\n**Sleepless** is a Horror-Adventure-Action game made _by kaitek666_, based on Source Engine. The game is still in development. Young, 32 years old man, Bill Brown's got very normal life with his lovely wife Alice. Both are in a good marriage, but in the last weeks, they haven't been enjoying their relationship. When Bill comes bit late home after work, he just goes to bed. But, during night, something strange happens in their house. Something, which changes Bill's life forever and makes him fight to survive.\r\n\r\nWe can't tell you nothing more about our game, but keep checking this page to find out more about it. Hope you like it as well as I do while developing it. Have fun while shitting to your pants.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nMy game has got a lot of features. I had to group them and make it editable for me. However, this is not complete list of features, and it will be updated very soon, many times.\r\n\r\n**Done**\r\n* Movement\r\n* Weapons\r\n* Color correction shaders\r\n* Voice\r\n\r\n**To-Do / Implementing now**\r\n* Deferred shaders\r\n* Maps\r\n* Prop models\r\n* Basic sounds change\r\n* More textures\r\n* Skyboxes\r\n* Music\r\n* Lans flare shader\r\n\r\n**Canceled**\r\n* Linux and Xbox 360 support\r\n* More guns than expected\r\n\r\n### When it will be released?\r\nWell, as you know, it takes very much time to make and finally release new game. The worse point is, I've got a lot of my own stuff to do like school, etc. I'm really hope it will be released by the end of August 2014. It'll be 100% free to download and play. Singleplayer ONLY.\r\n\r\n### Can I use a part of your code?\r\nSure! But remember to give me a credit.
